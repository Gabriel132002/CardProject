# id_project

My first Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for my Flutter career it just a layout with a image and a few simple widgets.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- I've learned the basics of flutter with this YouTube playlist https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ
- Note: this playlist is a little bit older but the comments helps a lot
- I also used the flutter documentation to learn the basics too https://docs.flutter.dev/
